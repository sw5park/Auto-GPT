# Refactoring Tool: Autonomous Code Refactoring System

Refactoring Tool is a codebase that assists with code analysis and refactoring suggestions. It uses AI to analyze code and provide insights on how to improve its performance, readability, and maintainability.

This effort is part of the @sw5park Otto project, which aims to develop an autonomous decision-making system for software development.


## Features

The project comprises the following components:

* agent_management: Contains agent classes responsible for different aspects of code refactoring.
* refactoring_tool: Includes the main functionality of the tool, such as code analysis, code improvement, and test generation.
* config: Contains configuration files, such as refactoring_config.yaml.
* requirements.txt: Lists the project's Python dependencies.
* run_tests.py: Runs the test suite for the entire project.
* scripts: Contains the run.py script to execute the Refactoring Tool.
* tests: Contains unit tests for the various components of the project.

## Installation & Usage

_TODO: Currently under active development. Will be integrated into @sw5park's Otto project for autonomous decision making.

1. Clone the repository:

* git clone https://github.com/user/refactoring-tool.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

* cd refactoring-tool
* pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Refactoring Tool:

* python scripts/run.py -c config/refactoring_config.yaml


The `-c` flag is followed by the path to the refactoring configuration file.
